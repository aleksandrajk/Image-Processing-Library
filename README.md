# Image-Processing-Library
Image Processing Library is a C++ library designed for performing various image processing tasks on images.
This library provides functions to manipulate images, apply filters, perform edge detection, enhance image quality, and more. It aims to simplify image processing tasks by offering an easy-to-use interface while maintaining efficient processing.

## Features
ImageProc++ offers the following features:
1. __2-D Discrete Convolution__: Perform convolution operations on images using custom kernels for tasks like blurring, sharpening, and more.
2. __Edge-Detection__: Detect edges in images using techniques like Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt edge detection.
3. __Spatial Filtering__: Apply spatial filters to images for noise reduction and enhancement.
4. __Image Histogram and Equalization__: Calculate image histograms and perform histogram equalization to enhance image contrast.
5. __Gray Level Transformation__: Perform gray-level transformations such as contrast stretching, thresholding, and gamma correction.
6. __Noise Suppression__: Apply filters and techniques to suppress noise in images, improving overall image quality.
7. __Other Utilities__: Additional utilities for basic image manipulation, like resizing, rotating, and basic arithmetic operations.
